// I've tried to configure the split view in a manner that the sidebar should never be collapsed
// However, when restoring state from a previous version of Postgres.app, it is possible that
// the subview is restored in a collapsed state. For this reason, we make sure that all
// subviews of the splitview are unhidden after restoring state
//
// A side effect of this workaround is that if a subview is ever collapsed due to a bug in macOS,
// then restarting the app should fix the problem.

	override func restoreState(with coder: NSCoder) {
